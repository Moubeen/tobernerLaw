                    <div class="__lawyer_description">
                    <p>Joseph Tobener is a partner at Tobener Ravenscroft. An attorney for more than twenty years, Mr. Tobener draws on his specialized tenant law expertise to provide caring, easy-to-understand, and aggressive assistance to a diverse clientele.  

                    He has represented thousands of Bay Area residents on tenant law issues and earned millions on behalf of his clients. He has appeared on KALW, NPR, and KQED and was featured in the SF Bay Guardian, the Daily Journal, and California Lawyer. Cases he has successfully litigated have been featured in the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Times, Reuters, Wired, and the Los Angeles Times. 

                    He has spoken extensively on tenant law for the San Francisco Bar Association and the Alameda Bar Association.  His clients have included countless lawyers, high-tech executives, mobile home residents, the San Francisco Tenants Union, and several art collectives. One of his passions is working to preserve artist live/work housing. He also worked for Home Base, a homelessness law nonprofit and has been an adjunct professor at San Francisco State University and 
                    UC Hastings. 

                    The firm is dedicated to employee activism, and sponsors each of its lawyers to volunteer weekly in the community at housing rights nonprofits, donating nearly 500 attorney hours each year.

                    Joe was selected to the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 Northern California Super Lawyer list by Super Lawyers, an honor reserved for lawyers who exhibit excellence in practice. 
                    Only 2.5% of attorneys in Northern California receive this distinction.</p>
